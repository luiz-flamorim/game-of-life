# Game of Life

This is a creative implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life, a cellular automaton where simple rules give rise to complex, dynamic behaviours. This version is built using JavaScript and the HTML5 canvas, with an added feature: click anywhere to reheat the simulation and spawn a fresh random state.

## Features
- Interactive canvas-based simulation
- Grid of cells that live, die, or are born based on neighbouring cells
- Click the canvas to regenerate the world with a new random seed
- Minimalistic, artistic twist on the classic algorithm

## How to Run
- Clone or download this repository.
- Open index.html in your browser.
- Click anywhere on the canvas to restart the simulation with a new pattern.

## Customisation
You can tweak the following parameters in app.js:
- cols, rows: Number of columns and rows in the grid
- cellSize: Size of each cell in pixels
- Colour scheme, update speed, or ruleset (for experimentation)
